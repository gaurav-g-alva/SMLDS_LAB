### Prg 3: A dataset contains information about car models, including the engine size (in Liters), fuel efficiency (miles per gallon), and car price. Use a pair plot or correlation matrix to explore the relationships between these variables. Which variables seem to have the strongest relationships, and what might be the practical significance of these findings?


```python
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt


df = pd.read_csv("car_dataset.csv")

print("First 5 rows of dataset:")
print(df.head())
print("--Generating pair plot--")
sns.pairplot(df,diag_kind="hist")
plt.suptitle("Pair plot of car dataset",y=1.02)
plt.show()

corr_matrix=df.corr(numeric_only=True)
plt.figure(figsize=(8,6))
sns.heatmap(corr_matrix,annot=True, cmap="coolwarm", fmt=".2f")
plt.title("Correlation Matrix of car dataset")
plt.show()

print("\n Correlation Matrix")
print(corr_matrix)
corr_matrix
```

**Interpretation**

**Strongest Positive Correlation:**
Between Engine Size (L) and Car Price (INR) **(0.955)**, indicating that larger engine sizes are strongly associated with higher car prices.

**Strongest Negative Correlation:**
Between Fuel Efficiency (MPG) and Car Price (INR) **(-0.250)**, showing a weak negative relationship where more fuel-efficient cars tend to be slightly less expensive.

**Other Negative Correlation:**
There is no other meaningful negative correlation in the matrix; the correlation between Engine Size (L) and Fuel Efficiency (MPG) is very close to zero **(0.022)**, indicating almost no linear relationship.

**Practical Significance**

**Manufacturers face a trade-off:** Larger engines â†’ higher price but only a slight impact on fuel efficiency.

**Consumers may prefer:**

**High MPG cars (cost-efficient, environmentally friendly, and generally less expensive).**

**Large engines (luxury/performance, but significantly more expensive).****

This analysis helps car buyers and automobile companies understand the balance between price, performance, and fuel efficiency.
